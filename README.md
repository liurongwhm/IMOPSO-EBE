1.If you would like to test this code, please refer to parset.m for how the data is entered and how the parameters are set,and we will give two datasets for a demo.

2.Note the parameter ParSet.th, if you set it to 0 then in the code run you will need to enter the appropriate threshold in matlab's command window based on the displayed histogram.
