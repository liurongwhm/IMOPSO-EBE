1.If you would like to test this code, please refer to parset.m for how the data is entered and how the parameters are set,and we will give two datasets for a demo.

2.Note the parameter ParSet.th, if you set it to 0 then in the code run you will need to enter the appropriate threshold in matlab's command window based on the displayed histogram.

3.We uploaded the test dataset to Google Cloud Drive : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TKliiqTyWWCuu2QQGYX9JJv5oe1yR6rO?usp=sharing
